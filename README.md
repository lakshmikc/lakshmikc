# Hi, I'm Lakshmi 👋

I am a computational biologist and AI/ML scientist with a simple conviction: **messy biological data holds the answers to some of medicine's hardest questions**
And the right tools can unlock them.

## 🔬 What I Work On

I design and develop reproducible, interpretable, and scalable analysis systems for:

- **Multi-omics integration** — RNA-seq, single-cell, proteomics, GWAS/QTL, and metabolomics  
- **Target identification & prioritization** — evidence synthesis + ML ranking  
- **Phenotype stratification & systems biology models**  
- **Cloud-native, reproducible bioinformatics workflows**


**Open-Source Bioinformatics Tools**

I am in the process of building modular, community-ready workflows and platforms to accelerate translational discovery:

- End-to-end target discovery pipelines  
- Reproducible ML evaluation templates for biological datasets  
- Standardized scRNA-seq and multi-data integration workflows  
- Knowledge-integration frameworks for evidence-based prioritization

These tools are designed to help scientists move from data → hypothesis → validation.

## Current Focus

- Interpretable ML for target prioritization  
- Modular, reusable computational infrastructure  
- Scalable multi-dataset evidence integration  
- Translational genomics and precision medicine\
  
## 🧬 Research Areas

- 🫀 Cardiometabolic diseases & obesity
- 🧠 Neuroscience & cardiac neurobiology  
- 🫁 Liver disease & hepatology
- 🧪 Functional genomics & transcriptomics
- 🤖 AI-driven target identification & validation
- 📊 Causal inference & biomarker discovery

## 🌱 My Philosophy

> *"I enjoy building tools and algorithms that help scientists and clinicians make sense of messy biological data — because good science deserves good tools."*

I believe open science accelerates discovery. Everything I build here is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and community-ready. Whether you're a PhD student running your first RNA-seq analysis or a seasoned computational biologist looking for a robust pipeline, I hope something here is useful to you.

Pull requests, issues, and collaborations are always welcome. 🤝
