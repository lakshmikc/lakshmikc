# Hi, I'm Lakshmi 👋

I am a computational biologist and AI/ML scientist with a simple conviction: **messy biological data holds the answers to some of medicine's hardest questions** — and the right tools can unlock them.

Over the past 20 years, I've worked at the intersection of biology, physics, and data science — moving from academic research labs to biotech industry — always driven by the same goal: building algorithms and platforms that help scientists and clinicians see patterns where there was once only noise.

## 🔬 What I Work On

My work lives at the crossroads of several fields:

**Multi-Omics Integration & Systems Biology**
I integrate RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, proteomics, GWAS, and metabolomics data to build systems-level views of disease. I believe no single data type tells the whole story — the magic is in the connections.

**AI/ML for Drug Discovery**
I design and deploy machine learning platforms — including large-scale target discovery engines — that combine internal experimental data with public genomic, genetic, and clinical resources to prioritize therapeutic targets in cardiometabolic diseases, neuroscience, and hepatology.

**Open-Source Bioinformatics Tools**
Science moves faster when tools are shared. I build reproducible, well-documented pipelines and platforms designed to be used, adapted, and improved by the broader community. If you're a scientist wrestling with complex biological data, you're in the right place.

## 🌱 My Philosophy

> *"I enjoy building tools and algorithms that help scientists and clinicians make sense of messy biological data — because good science deserves good tools."*

I believe open science accelerates discovery. Everything I build here is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and community-ready. Whether you're a PhD student running your first RNA-seq analysis or a seasoned computational biologist looking for a robust pipeline, I hope something here is useful to you.

Pull requests, issues, and collaborations are always welcome. 🤝
